The problem with this approach is that some people may use the ecommerce both with phone and with desktop (such as search something in the phone and then buy on the PC). Since those data will be obfuscated, we can try to minimize the damage by taking a random entry of the user.\n",

I consider this to be a good information to get people that are already engaged with the website and, of the overall users, how much uses with smartphone. The second info is almost the same as the first, except that I'm taking the ```eventType = 'page'``` to get people that browses throw the ecommerce.
